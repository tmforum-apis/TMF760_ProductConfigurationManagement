# TMF760 Product Configuration Management

TM Forum Open API (Apache 2.0) Product Configuration Management API.

The Product Configuration API drives the configuration of new product offerings and modification of existing products for various user engagement channels. The Product Configuration API uses product catalog data, policy data, and existing product inventory data to assist engagement managent systems with product configuration. Product configuration may include setting and restricting characteristic values, enforcing min/max on bundle offering groups and options, and calculation of prices and discounts.
